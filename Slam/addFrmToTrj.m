%   [Trj,Frm,Fac] = ADDFRMTOTRJ(Trj,Frm,Fac) Adds a frame to the trajectory

%   and clearing sensitive data in the frame pointed by the new HEAD.
%
%   The trajectory is a circular array, so when all positions are full,
%   adding a new frame overwrites the oldest one. In such case, all factors
%   linking to the discarded frame are cleared.
%
%   The added frame is empty, and only its ID is created, distinct to all
%   other IDs.
