function [Trj,Frm,Fac] = addFrmToTrj(Trj,Frm,Fac)

% ADDFRMTOTRJ Add frame to trajectory
%   [Trj,Frm,Fac] = ADDFRMTOTRJ(Trj,Frm,Fac) Adds a frame to the trajectory
%   Trj. It does so by advancing the HEAD pointer in the trajectory Trj,
%   and clearing sensitive data in the frame pointed by the new HEAD.
%
%   The trajectory is a circular array, so when all positions are full,
%   adding a new frame overwrites the oldest one. In such case, all factors
%   linking to the discarded frame are cleared.
%
%   The added frame is empty, and only its ID is created, distinct to all
%   other IDs.


% Advance HEAD
Trj.head = mod(Trj.head, Trj.maxLength) + 1;

% Update TAIL
if Trj.length < Trj.maxLength

    % Trj is not yet full. Just lengthen.
    Trj.length = Trj.length + 1;

else
    % Trj was full. Tail frame will be overwritten !!
    
    % Delete factors from tail before advancing
    [Fac(Frm(Trj.tail).factors).used] = deal(false);
    [Fac(Frm(Trj.tail).factors).frames] = deal([]);
    % TODO delete landmarks linked only by the tail frame
    
    % Advance TAIL
    Trj.tail = mod(Trj.tail, Trj.maxLength) + 1;
    
    % Clear motion factors at new tail relating to older frames that have
    % disappeared
    Frm(Trj.tail).factors = Frm(Trj.tail).factors(end);
    
    
end

% Complete the new frame
Frm(Trj.head).id = newId;
Frm(Trj.head).factors = [];
