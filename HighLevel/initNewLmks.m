function Lmk = initNewLmks(Rob, Sen, SimObs, Lmk)

%  INITNEWLMKS  initialise some new landmarks from recent observations.
%   LMK = INITNEWLMKS(ROB, SEN, SIMOBS, LMK) returns the new set of
%   landmarks.
%     This "new set" contains the "old set" plus new elements. These new
%     elements are extracted from the recent observations (SIMOBS), from
%     the current state estimated (ROB for robot and SEN for the sensor).
