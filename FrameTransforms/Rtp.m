function [rtp,RTPq,RTPp] = Rtp(q,p)

% RTP  Transposed rotation matrix (from quaternion) times vector.
%   RTP(Q,P) evaluates the product
%
%       q2R(Q)'*P
%
%   where Q is a quaternion and P is a 3D point or a matrix of 3D points. A
%   matrix of 3D points is defined P = [P1 ... Pn] with each Pi =
%   [xi;yi;zi].
%
%   [rp,RPq,RPp] = RP(Q,P) returns Jacobians wrt Q and P. Note that this
%   only works with single points P = [x;y;z].
%
%   See also RP, Q2R.
