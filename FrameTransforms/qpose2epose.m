function [ep,EPq] = qpose2epose(qp)

% QPOSE2EPOSE  Quaternion-specified to Euler-specified pose conversion.
%
%   EP = QPOSE2EPOSE(QP) returns a full 6-pose EP=[X;E] from a full 7-pose
%   QP=[X;Q] where X is 3D opsition and Q and E are 3D orientations.
%
%   [EP,Jqp] = QPOSE2EPOSE(...) returns also the Jacobian matrix.
