    % From this point on, we should be able to solve for dx. For this,
    % follow these steps (you must code steps 1 to 5):
    %
    
    % 1) Apply reordering
    %   Use colamd() on matrix H
    %   Store the result in permutation vector pr
    
    % 2) Get the Choolesky decomposition of H
    %   Use chol() on the reordered H
    %   Check for ill-conditioning of H and issue an error if necessary
    %   Type '> help chol' for help.
    %   Store the result in Map.R
    
    % 3) Solve R'*y = b and R*dx = y
    %   Use operator '\'. Type '> help \' for help
    %   Store the result in variable dx
    
    % 4) Transfer dx to Map.x 
    %   Use the permutation vector pr computed in 1).
    
    % At this point, we have the update step stored in the Map variable, in
    % Map.x, in the original ordering.
    
    % 5) We can use this step to update each of the state blocks:
    %   - All the Frames in Frm    --- use updateKeyFrame()
    %   - All the landmarks in Lmk --- use a linear update.
    % Type '> help updateKeyFrame' for help.
    
    
    % The algorithm continues by checking the new residual error and
    % deciding on whether it is necessary to continue iterating. You do
    % not have to code this part.
        
    % Check resulting errors

function Fac = buildProblem(Rob,Sen,Lmk,Obs,Frm,Fac)

% BUILDPROBLEM Build least squares problem's matrix H and vector b 
%   Fac = BUILDPROBLEM(Rob,Sen,Lmk,Obs,Frm,Fac) Builds the least squares
%   problem's matrix H and vector b for a solution using sparse Cholesky
%   factorization of H.

global Map

% In this function, we build the problem to be solved by Cholesky
% factorization. The goal, then, is to enter the right values in the
% Hessian matrix,
%
%   Map.H
%
% and the error vector,
%
%   Map.b
%
% using the methods in the documentation, see graphSLAM.pdf.

% The variable Map stores the following important fields (type
% '> diginto(Map)' for the full structure)
%
%   Map.H : preallocated Hessian matrix
%   Map.b : preallocated error vector
%   Map.mr: vector of indices of all states used.
%
% the indices vector Map.mr is very useful to exploit sparsity. Use it as
% follows:
%
%   mr = Map.mr:  <-- just to make a short name for these notes
%
%   H = Map.H(mr,mr) is the current Hessian matrix, using only the states
%   currently active in the problem.
%
%   b = Map.b(mr) is the current error vector, using only the states
%   currently active in the problem.
%
% To filll the blocks of Map.H and Map.b, you need to access them via the
% ranges of the state blocks you are considering. Examples:
%
%   rr = Frm.state.r <-- vector of indices to the robot's state block
%   lr = Lmk.state.r <-- vectos of indices to the landmark's state block
%
% you can use these ranges to access the appropriate blocks in the Hessian:
%
%   Map.H(rr,rr) is the Hessian block of the robot
%   Map.H(lr,lr) is the Hessian block of the landmark
%   Map.H(rr,lr) is the Hessian block of the robot and landmark
%   Map.H(lr,rr) is the Hessian block of the landmark and robot
%
% Similarly, we can access the  error vector blocks with Map.b(rr) and
% Map.b(lr).

% To write this function, follow the Cholesky algorithm in courseSLAM.pdf.
% We provide the error function computeError(), returning the following
% fields (type '> help computeError' for help):
%
%   Fac: an updated structure for the factor Fac
%   e  : the factor error
%   W  : the factor information matrix
%   Wsq: the square root of W
%   J1 : the Jacobian wrt the first state block
%   J2 : the Jacobian wrt the second state block
%   r1 : the range of the first state block
%   r2 : the range of the second state block
%
% Easily, the ranges r1 and r2 are used instead of rr and rl in the example
% above.
%
% Similarly, the Jacobians J1 and J2 are used to compute the Hessian blocks
% and error vector blocks. Again, consult the Cholesky algorithm in
% courseSLAM.pdf.

% It follows a guideline of the code you need to insert

% 1) Reset Hessian H and error vector b

% 2) Iterate for all factors present in the problem
for fac = find([Fac.used])
    
    % 2.a Extract relevant pointers for the factor
    % rob    = <-- robot associated to the factor...
    % sen    = <-- sensor   ... idem ...
    % lmk    = <-- landmark ... idem ...
    % frames = <-- frames   ... idem ...
    
    % 2.b Compute factor error, info mat, and Jacobians
    [Fac(fac), e, W, ~, J1, J2, r1, r2] = computeError(...
        Rob(rob),       ...
        Sen(sen),       ...
        Lmk(lmk),       ...
        Obs(sen,lmk),   ...
        Frm(frames),    ...
        Fac(fac));

    % 2.c Compute sparse Hessian blocks
    % H_11 = <-- block 1-1;
    % H_12 = <-- block 1-2;
    % H_22 = <-- block 2-2;
    % H_21 = <-- block 2-1;
    
    % 2.d Compute rhs vector blocks
    % b1   = <-- block 1;
    % b2   = <-- block 2;
    
    % 2.e Update H and b
    % Map.H(r1,r1) = <-- block 1-1;
    % ... etc for the other blocks of Map.H and Map.b.
