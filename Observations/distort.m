function [ud,UDup,UDdist] = distort(up,dist,rmax)

% DISTORT  Distorts projected point with radial distortion.
%   DISTORT(UP,DIST) computes the position in the image plane of
%   the distorted pixel corresponding to the projected pixel UP.
%   DIST is the vector of distortion parameters. Distortion is
%   calculated with the radial distortion model:
%
%     UD = UP * (1 + k2*r^2 + k4*r^4 + k6*r^6 + ...)
%
%   where r^2  = UP(1)^2 + UP(2)^2
%     and DIST = [k4 k4 k6 ...]
%
%   [ud,UDup,UDdist] = DISTORT(...) returns Jacobians wrt UP and DIST. Only
%   DIST vectors of up to order 3 are supported. If a higher order is
%   desired use a Jacobian builder at the bottom of DISTORT.M file (and read the
%   notes that come with it).
%

%   FIXME: RMAX works not so nice
%   DISTORT(...,RMAX) accepts the maximum image radius to limit the effect
%   of distortion to the image plane. The image radius is one half of the
%   image diagonal. In case norm(UP) > RMAX then UD = RMAX/norm(UP)*UP. The
%   Jacobians are trivially computed just for argument consistency: UDup =
%   eye(2) and UDdist = zeros(2,length(dist)).
