function writeProcessedImg(rob,sen,frm,Raw)

% WRITEPROCESSEDIMG  Write processed image data to file.
%   R = WRITEPROCESSEDIMG(R,S,F) writes the processed image for sensor S in
%   robot R corresponding to frame F. R and S are Rob and Sen structures in
%   SLAMTB. F is an integer corresponding to the frame number.
%
%   The processed image contains simply the coordinates of all the features
%   detected, with an identifier. See below for the file format.
%
%   The file written has the following name format
%       Directory: ./data/
%       Name: img-RR-SS-FFFFFF.txt 
%   where RR and SS are the robot and sensor numbers (2 digits each) and
%   FFFFFF is the frame number (6 digits).
%   The file contains one line per feature, containing identifier and UV
%   coordinates separated by tabs:
%           id1  U1  V1
%           id2  U2  V2
%           ...
%           idn  Un  Vn
