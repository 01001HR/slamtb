function writeControlSignal(Rob,frm)

% WRITECONTROLSIGNAL  Write robot's control signal to file.
%   WRITECONTROLSIGNAL(R,F) writes a file with the the control signal for
%   robot R corresponding to frame F. R is a Rob structure in SLAMTB. F is
%   an integer corresponding to the frame number.
%
%   The file written has the following name format
%       Directory: ./data/
%       Name: control-RR-FFFFFF.txt
%   where RR is the robot number (2 digits) and FFFFFF is the frame number
%   (6 digits).
%   The file contains two lines: the control vector and covariances matrix:
%           u1 u2 u3 ... un
%           U11 U12 ... U1n U21 U22 ... Unn
%   where n is the dimension of the control vector.
%
%   See also READCONTROLSIGNAL, READPROCESSEDIMG, WRITEPROCESSEDIMG.
