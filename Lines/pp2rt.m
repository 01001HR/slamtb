function [rt,RTp,RTq] = pp2rt(p,q)

% PP2RT  Points to rho theta 2D line conversion.
%   PP2RT(P,Q) is the rho-theta line in the plane joining the
%   two  points P and Q. P and Q can be either Euclidean 2-points or
%   homogeneous 3-points.
%  
%   [rt,RTp,RTq] = POINTS2RT(p,q) returns the Jacobians wrt P and Q.
