function idl = app2idpLin(p0,p1,p2)

% APP2IDL Anchor and points to inverse depth line conversion.
%   APP2IDL(P0,P1,P2) converts the line passing by the points P1 and P2
%   into the inverse-depth line anchored at point P0. the inverse depth
%   line is coded as
%
%       [P0;M1;R1;M2;R2]
%
%   where
%       P0 is the anchor point
%       Mi are the pitch and yaw director angles of the ray P0-Pi
%       Ri is the inverse of the distance from P0 to Pi
