%   [ LMK, FRMS, FACS ] = PAPTESTANCHORONFRM( ROB, SEN, LMK, OBS , FRMS,
%   FACS, CURRFRMIDX, CURRFACIDX ) test if the frame FRMS(CURRFRMIDX) is a
%   better anchor than the current main and associated anchor frames, and
%   perform a reanchoring if needed. Note we consider here that the a
%   projection factor to the current frame was already added to the graph.
% 
%   The test is based on the parallax angle values computed using the frame
%   estimates and the observations from these frames. We do not reanchor if
%   the current parallax is above a MAXPARTHRESHOLD. The reanchoring
%   procedure is composed of the following steps:
%      1. update FACS.FRAMES of projection factors to this landmark;
%      2. update LMK.ANCHORFAC
%      3. update pointers on LMK.PAR
%      4. update LMK.STATE.X
